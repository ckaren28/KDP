    <p style="max-width: 75ch;">
      I am an early-career fashion designer currently building hands-on experience in garment construction,
      tailoring, and studio work. My background includes formal coursework in fashion design, where I developed
      a strong foundation in sewing, pattern work, and design process.
    </p>
  
    <p style="max-width: 75ch;">
      I’m especially interested in roles that allow me to work closely with garments—whether in tailoring,
      studio assistance, or design support—and I’m motivated by environments where learning, precision,
      and collaboration are valued.
    </p>
  
    <p style="max-width: 75ch;">
      I am currently seeking entry-level opportunities in fashion studios, tailoring, and design teams.
